# Feature Scope and Specification Command

**Description**: Comprehensive scoping and specification generation for new feature requests. Analyzes requirements, defines scope boundaries, creates structured specifications, and provides implementation roadmap.

**Usage**: `/feature-scope [feature-description] [--priority=high|medium|low] [--complexity=simple|medium|complex] [--timeline=days|weeks|months]`

**Examples**:
- `/feature-scope "Add user authentication with OAuth2 support"`
- `/feature-scope "Implement real-time chat functionality" --priority=high --complexity=complex`
- `/feature-scope "Create admin dashboard for user management" --timeline=weeks`

# Feature Scope and Specification Generator

## Context Gathering

### Project Analysis
```bash
!get-context project
```

### Architecture Context  
```bash
!get-context architecture
```

### Dependency Analysis
```bash
!get-context dependencies
```

### Current Feature Analysis
```bash
!get-context csharp | head -50
```

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis

### 1.1 Feature Request Parsing
Parse the provided feature description from $ARGUMENTS:
- Extract core functionality requirements
- Identify stakeholders and user personas
- Determine business objectives and success criteria
- Capture any constraints or non-functional requirements

### 1.2 Domain Context Research
Use the Task tool with specialized agents for domain analysis:

```markdown
Task(description="Analyze domain context and similar features", subagent_type="research-documenter")
```

Research similar features in the ecosystem:
- Industry best practices and patterns
- Common implementation approaches
- Technology stack compatibility
- Integration patterns with existing architecture

### 1.3 Stakeholder Impact Analysis
Identify all affected stakeholders:
- End users and their workflows
- Development team responsibilities
- Operations and maintenance implications
- Business process changes

## Phase 2: Scope Definition

### 2.1 Feature Boundary Analysis
Use the Task tool for comprehensive scope analysis:

```markdown
Task(description="Define feature boundaries and scope", subagent_type="project-scope-definer")
```

Define what's included and excluded:
- Core features for MVP
- Nice-to-have enhancements
- Out-of-scope items
- Future iteration possibilities

### 2.2 Technical Scope Assessment
Analyze technical implications:
- Architecture changes required
- New dependencies and integrations
- Database schema modifications
- API contract changes
- Security considerations

### 2.3 Complexity and Risk Assessment
Evaluate implementation complexity:
- **Simple**: Single component, minimal dependencies
- **Medium**: Multiple components, some integration
- **Complex**: Cross-cutting concerns, significant architecture changes

Risk factors:
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Business risks and contingencies
- Timeline risks and dependencies

## Phase 3: Specification Generation

### 3.1 Functional Requirements (EARS Format)
Generate structured requirements using EARS notation:

**WHEN** [trigger condition] **THEN** [system response]

Examples:
- WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect to dashboard
- WHEN an invalid request is received THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error message

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Specify quality attributes:
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, scalability
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Reliability**: Availability, fault tolerance, recovery
- **Usability**: User experience, accessibility
- **Maintainability**: Code quality, documentation, testability

### 3.3 Technical Specifications
Use architectural analysis for detailed specs:

```markdown
Task(description="Create technical architecture specification", subagent_type="solution-architect")
```

Include:
- Component diagrams and interactions
- Data models and schema changes
- API specifications and contracts
- Integration points and dependencies
- Configuration requirements

## Phase 4: Implementation Planning

### 4.1 Work Breakdown Structure
Use project planning for task decomposition:

```markdown
Task(description="Create detailed implementation plan", subagent_type="project-planner")
```

Break down into:
- Discrete development tasks
- Task dependencies and sequencing
- Resource requirements
- Skill set needs

### 4.2 Timeline and Milestone Planning
Estimate based on complexity parameter:
- **Simple**: 1-5 days, single developer
- **Medium**: 1-4 weeks, small team
- **Complex**: 1-6 months, full team coordination

Milestones:
- Design approval and sign-off
- Core functionality implementation
- Integration and testing
- Documentation and deployment

### 4.3 Testing Strategy
Define comprehensive testing approach:
- Unit testing requirements
- Integration testing scenarios
- User acceptance testing criteria
- Performance testing benchmarks
- Security testing procedures

## Phase 5: Documentation Generation

### 5.1 Requirements Document
Create `requirements.md` with:
- Executive summary and business case
- Detailed functional requirements in EARS format
- Non-functional requirements and constraints
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### 5.2 Technical Design Document  
Create `design.md` with:
- System architecture overview
- Component and sequence diagrams
- Data model specifications
- API contract definitions
- Security and performance considerations

### 5.3 Implementation Plan
Create `tasks.md` with:
- Prioritized task breakdown
- Dependencies and sequencing
- Resource allocation and timeline
- Testing and validation checkpoints
- Documentation and deployment tasks

## Phase 6: Validation and Review

### 6.1 Specification Review
Validate completeness:
- All requirements traceable to business objectives
- Technical feasibility confirmed
- Resource estimates realistic
- Risks properly identified and mitigated

### 6.2 Stakeholder Alignment
Ensure specification addresses:
- User needs and workflows
- Business objectives and constraints
- Technical architecture compatibility
- Operational requirements

### 6.3 Implementation Readiness
Confirm development team has:
- Clear understanding of requirements
- Technical approach agreement
- Resource availability
- Tool and environment access
